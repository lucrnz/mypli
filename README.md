## api.lucdev.net
ðŸš€â€Š API for managing my personal website/services

## Infraestructure
Check the [External api](./External) for the code that goes directly to the WWW and it is contained within Docker.

Check the [Internal api](./Internal/) for the code that runs directly on my VPS and only listens to the "External api" requests.

## Personal usage

Currently this repo is not publicly avilable so there isn't documentation about it.

I might open source it in the future but currently I have no plans for doing so.
