## mypli
ðŸš€â€Š API for automatic remote deployment

## Infraestructure
Check the [main service](./mypli-main/) for the code that goes directly to the web and it is contained within Docker.

Check the [internal service](./mypli-internal/) for the code that runs directly on the server and has more privileges.

Both services need to be running for the program to work correctly.

## Personal usage

Currently this repo is not publicly avilable so there isn't documentation about it.

I might open source it in the future but currently I have no plans for doing so.
